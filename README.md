== Conext logger ==

It's UNDER DEVELOPMENT. Not ready for use.

Aim of this application is log inverter data to database and provide interface
to read live data and navigate historical data.

Technologies used:
Node / ECMAScript 6
modbus-serial
node-crontab
express
PostgreSQL
sequelize
angular

It's a result of my investigation of Schneider Electric Conext RL solar inverter
modbus protocol which is badly documentated.
